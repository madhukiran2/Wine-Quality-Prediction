# Wine-Quality-Prediction

Quality wine is important as world's wine consumption is over 1.1 billion gallons in 2021 already. It is hard to value a wine based on human quality assessment. We can use the features of a wine to accurately predict the quality score of a wine using algorithms.

The dataset can be viewed as classification or regression tasks. The classes are ordered and not balanced (e.g. there are many more normal wines than excellent or poor ones). Outlier detection algorithms could be used to detect the few excellent or poor wines. Also, we are not sure if all input variables are relevant. So it could be interesting to test feature selection methods.

In this project we are going to build prediction models for the white wine based on 11 features.

Problem Statement: The data is related to white vinho verde wine samples, from the north of Portugal. The goal is to model wine quality based on physicochemical tests. I plan to predict the quality of the white vinho verde wine which is my target variable from the features like fixed acidity,volatile acidity, citric acid, free sulfur dioxide, pH, sulphates and many more by using machine learning modules like Decision Tree, Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine.

Target variable - Predicting the quality of white wine
Input variables - fixed acidity,volatile acidity, citric acid, free sulfur dioxide, pH, sulphates, residual sugar, chlorides, total sulfur dioxide, density and alcohol.
